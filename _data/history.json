In this talk, we learn a way to take a mess - a working code that does provide value every single day - turn that code into testable, cover it with tests and then to use a counter-intuitive way to refactor that code into something where domain concepts find their own places while making modifications easy. Taking an untested mess is a challenge we face in real life. This talk is based on a series of exercises that can be worked on separately, built into a bigger code challenge. The talk goes through the thinking on how to approach such a challenge. Why is it important to add test cases? Why is it important to make the production code testable, in order to be able to test it? Why test readability is so important? And then - how to make a mess to let the design to find it’s shape. This talk has 3 concepts 1) How to turn hard-to-test code into easy-to-test code 2) How to write a test case (and why) 3) How to find a business abstraction thinking outside-in",

With modern tooling and some JSDoc you can turn a JavaScript project into a type safe one, without compromising on portability or developer experience. And as you delve deeper into the rabbit hole, maybe even unlock some new features. Developers of large projects like Svelte and Remix have already started transitioning to a more frictionless developer experience by embracing Javascript as it is, but by providing valuable typeing support through JSDoc and the TypeScript compiler. In this hands-on talk we'll take a look at the featureset a JSDoc + Javascript development environment provides, and how you can write type safe code without the drawbacks of build systems and transpiling.",

I'll explore how these dimensions transform the user interface and challenge us to think outside the conventional pixel box. We'll delve into creating interfaces where actions are triggered by physical movement, such as throwing an object to a precise height with certain speed of rotation. I'll discuss how we navigate design when our 'screen' is a mere 64x64 pixels, how statistics are replaced with emotions, and how the PALL0 platform’s sensors redefine user engagement, making every interaction both intuitive and playful.

The usage of sliders have transformed from auto-playing full-wide hero carousels to more subtle UIs. Mobile performance, touch gestures and accessibility requirements have put more requirements on the libraries we use. I'll demonstrate how we can use CSS overflow:auto and JS enhancements to power-up the new generation of sliders that some notable sites like IKEA is already using. I show the possibilities and limitations of CSS and what kind of native JS APIs browser offers for this kind of slider. I have created a library @evermade/overflow-slider that is powered by these techniques.",

        "description": "One of the wonderful parts about the web, is that it is constantly evolving. This evolution solves common pain points, leads to less code sent to clients, and supports more performant and ambitious applications. However, this evolution brings pressure on web developers to track changes, and adapt our code to new practices. Browsers adopt features at different rates, so code paths often have to fork based on capabilities. In this talk, we will step through common ways of keeping a code base healthy in this changing environment, such as feature detection, automatic code transpilation and manual User Agent sniffing. We will also look at a way of handling an often-overlooked inverse case; knowing when to stop forking the code paths once a feature is available everywhere, in a sustainable and informed way.",

        "description": "Linters (e.g. eslint, stylelint) are common tools in FE development. Usually linters are configured to point out possible error situations related to JavaScript's curiosities (e.g. strict equality vs loose equality with eqeqeq rule), to follow a certain code style (remember the Airbnb config?) or follow a recommended ruleset from a library eslint plugin (e.g. eslint-plugin-react). But, have you seen a linter used to teach how to use a certain library? Or to manage tech debt (or at least make sure the debt does not spread)? How about make sure that the agreed conventions are being followed? In this talk, I will go through the basics of the linter and plugin ecosystem(s), list how we are using linters currently and demonstrate how we could unleash the full potential of using linters to speed up and make FE development easier.",

In this talk, we'll explore the power of WebSockets and WebRTC, how they work, when to use each, and how they can make your applications responsive and more engaging. You’ll learn how WebRTC's peer-to-peer connections support more than video, along with tips and security considerations. Through a live demo, we'll implement a web app that combines WebRTC and WebSockets, giving an example of combining the two browser-native technologies.",

Join us as we explore how these foundational technologies are shedding their static stereotypes and embracing dynamic interactivity, blurring the lines traditionally drawn by JavaScript. In this talk, we'll dive into the latest HTML and CSS features that are reshaping UI development. Learn how these features are gradually reducing our reliance on JavaScript in the 'front' of the frontend and moving some accessibility concerns, dynamic positioning, robust animations and more to the browser. Get lost, JavaScript! Just kidding. We still need you, but HTML and CSS do a lot more now.",

Through a live demo, we’ll discuss the idea of looking at software development from a data-schema-driven viewpoint, and its implications for traditional frontend-backend workflows.

I'll explain briefly how TC39 works and give a concrete outline of the steps needed to implement a new language feature. The talk is based on our own experience [ https://bldl.github.io/upsert-tutorial/ ] in implementing the Map.prototype.upsert proposal for the Firefox SpiderMonkey and Google V8 engines. I will also explain how to read the ECMA-262 specification, which is a skill necessary for any JavaScript developer who really wants to understand how a certain language feature is supposed to work. The talk is suitable for everyone interested in JavaScript, and especially for those who want to know how to suggest a new language feature and participate in implementing it. Mikhail is a delegate at Ecma International TC39, the standardizing body behind JavaScript. He is a co-chair of the TC39-TG5 Task Group on Experiments in Programming Language Standardization, and a member of Ecma International's Executive Committee.
